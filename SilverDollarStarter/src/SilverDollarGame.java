	 * 1. It must ask the players for a maximum number of coins.  
	 * 2. It must allow the players to play multiple games, until
	 * they decide they've played enough (use a sentinel loop).
	 * Each game should begin with a random number of coins.  
	 * Hint: use the swap algorithm to alternate between players
	 * 3. It must keep track of how many games have been played
	 * and the number of games won by each player.
